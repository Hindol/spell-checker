Qualcomm on Monday named former Intel executive Anand Chandrasekher chief marketing officer with responsibilities overseeing global marketing and external communications
The hire is an interesting one given that Chandrasekher's main claim to fame at Intel was in product development rather than marketing He led the chip giant's Ultra Mobility Group for several years before parting ways with the company in March 2011
I am pleased to welcome Anand Chandrasekher as chief marketing officer His extensive experience in marketing and management makes Anand well-suited to help grow Qualcomm's communications and marketing efforts across the world and to amplify our consumer offerings to new audiences Qualcomm president and chief operating officer Steve Mollenkopf said in a statement
In 25 years at Intel Chandrasekher led the product groups behind such famous brands as Centrino and Atom but his marketing bona fides were actually not inconsiderableâ€”in fact he had a stint as head of Intel's Worldwide Sales and Marketing Group at one point
As a top executive in Intel's Mobile Platform and later general manager of the Ultra Mobility Group Chandrasekher helped the company set the pace in an exploding laptop market and then struck gold briefly with the surprising success of the low-power Atom processor line in the short-lived but explosive netbook market in the latter years of last decade
But the even smaller mobile Internet devices (MIDs) that Intel and Chandrasekher were pushing as far back as 2007 never really took off Instead smartphones and then tablets with ultra-low power chipsets designed by Intel rival ARM emerged as consumer favorites knocking aside MIDs and even netbooks and leaving Intel flat-footed without a viable System-on-a-Chip alternative until very recently
So why Qualcomm and why now for Chandrasekher Patrick Moorhead lead analyst for Moor Insights and Strategy reckoned the hire could signal that mobile chipset specialist Qualcomm is gearing up for a push into other computing sectors where his old company looms large
Chandrasekher's appointment as Qualcomm CMO is interesting on a few vectors Most of his experience at Intel was around products and businesses not marketing and communications He led Intel's Menlow and Moorestown products as well as the netbook and MID initiatives Moorhead said
Chandrasekher is likely being brought in to get Qualcomm into the PC and server market where component marketing matters more than with embedded silicon for smartphones Qualcomm needs to beef up their marketing if it hopes to challenge Intel in any of their core markets he continued
If that is Qualcomm's strategy it wouldn't be particularly shocking because there are strong signs of big movement in computing sectors long dominated by one specific architecture or another Makers of ARM-based chips have been steadily pushing upwards into the PC and server markets traditionally served by x86 houses like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices for example while PC powerhouses Intel and Nvidia have recently been making solid inroads into mobile from the other side of the divide
The market value of Standard Chartered Plc tumbled as much as $17 billion on Tuesday after New York's bank regulator threatened to tear up its state banking licence for allegedly hiding $250 billion in transactions tied to Iran
The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) slammed the London-based but Asia-focused bank as a rogue institution that schemed with the Iranian government which is subject to US sanctions over its nuclear programme and hid 60000 secret transactions to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in fees over nearly 10 years
Shares in Standard Chartered were down 166 percent at 1226 pounds by 1420 GMT taking their losses to 24 percent since the news surfaced just before Monday's close They had earlier slumped as low as 1092 pounds their lowest for three years
Even the so-called 'safe' banks like StanChart and HSBC seem to be crumbling with their reputation in tatters No one it seems is immune said one institutional investor who asked not to be named
Some of the language used is very disturbing Of course it could be that the Americans are exaggerating but somehow that doesn't seem to be the case here the investor said
The bank which has been in talks with US authorities since early 2010 over the matter had exposed the US banking system to terrorists drug traffickers and corrupt states the DFS said
The New York regulator described how officials at Standard Chartered one of the banks least tarnished during the financial crisis thanks to its focus on emerging markets and a conservative approach to capital and liquidity had debated whether to continue Iranian dealings
In October 2006 the top official for business in the Americas whom the regulator did not name warned in a panicked message that the Iranian dealings could cause catastrophic reputational damage and serious criminal liability
A group executive director in London shot back according to a New York branch officer: You f---ing Americans Who are you to tell us the rest of the world that we're not going to deal with Iranians
The reply showed obvious contempt for US banking regulations the regulator said
At that time the bank had five executive directors: Peter Sands now chief executive; Richard Meddings now finance director; Mervyn Davies a UK Labour Party peer; Kai Nargolwala who was poached by Credit Suisse and left the Swiss bank last year; and Mike DeNoma who resigned as CEO of Chinatrust Financial <2891HK> in August
Standard Chartered's Americas CEO was Ray Ferguson who is now its Singapore CEO
None of the people could be reached for comment or else declined to comment
US RULES UNCLEAR
Standard Chartered said the bank does not believe the order issued by the DFS presents a full and accurate picture of the facts
The loss of a New York banking licence would be a devastating blow for a foreign bank effectively cutting off direct access to the US bank market Standard Chartered processes $190 billion every day for global clients the New York bank regulator said
David Proctor who worked for Standard Chartered from 1999 until 2006 and was CEO in UAE from March to June 2006 and had the Iran business briefly report to him said the rules on dealing with Iran were unclear
At the time (in May 2006) many international banks active in Iran were trying to adjust to increased attention from the US There was a lack of clarity over what was and wasn't allowed The key question was to try and understand exactly what counted as a U-turn transaction he said
The United States imposed economic sanctions on Iran in 1979 but until November 2008 US banks could process some transactions for Iranian banks or individuals provided they were initiated offshore by non-Iranian foreign banks and are on the way to other non-Iranian foreign banks known as U-turns
Proctor who now provides advice for banks with BAS Consulting in Singapore added: I don't think it's a matter of fighting this case; Standard Chartered just has to get to the bottom of what happened Banks these days don't have a choice You have to be transparent
Standard Chartered is the third British bank to be ensnared in US law enforcement probes this summer Barclays Plc agreed to pay $453 million to settle US and UK probes that it rigged a global lending benchmark in June
A month later a US Senate panel issued a scathing report that criticised HSBC Holding Plc's efforts to police suspect transactions including Mexican drug traffickers
STANCHART SAYS OVERWHELMINGLY COMPLIED
Standard Chartered said it shared with US agencies an analysis that demonstrated it acted to comply and overwhelmingly did comply with US regulations
Standard Chartered put the total value of Iran-related transactions that did not follow regulations at less than $14 million based on its review of the issue in stark contrast to the DFS's $250 billion estimate
Standard Chartered said the DFS's interpretation of the U-turn exemption is incorrect as a matter of law It said 999 percent of its transactions relating to Iran had complied with a US framework
The figure alleged by the New York regulator would cover the equivalent of 71 percent of the $350 billion total Iranian oil export revenues for the seven years of 2001-2007 according to OPEC data
The group was  surprised to receive the order from the DFS given that discussions with the agencies were ongoing Standard Chartered said We intend to discuss these matters with the DFS and to contest their position
The bank has to appear before the DFS on August 15
Some people were walking around under the illusion that Standard Chartered was the world's first riskless bank and it's not We've discovered that Standard Chartered is a mortal bank - as they all are said Gareth Hunt financials analyst at Canaccord Genuity who rates the stock a sell
Hugh Young managing director in Singapore at Aberdeen Asset Management Asia the third biggest shareholder in the bank said: It's something to worry about although I noticed a lot of emotive and sensational language which slightly diminishes the allegation
The StanChart we recognise is not the rogue bank portrayed in the allegation he added
Standard Chartered is the sixth foreign bank since 2008 to be implicated in dealings with sanctioned countries such as Iran in investigations led by federal and New York law enforcement officials
Four banks - Barclays Lloyds  Credit Suisse and ING - have agreed to fines and settlements totalling $18 billion HSBC currently is under investigation by US law enforcement according to bank regulatory filings
The New York regulator headed by former prosecutor Benjamin Lawsky ordered Standard Chartered to explain why the bank should not lose its state licence and the ability to process dollar transactions Lawsky also ordered the bank to bring in an outside consultant to monitor its transactions
Standard Chartered Bank operated as a rogue institution Lawsky said in the order
Lawsky's investigation is unusual because probes into banks' transactions tied to Iran have been primarily led by the district attorney's office in Manhattan and the US Justice Department
The cost to buy protection for five years against Standard Chartered defaulting on its debts rose to 166000 euros for 10 million euros' worth up from 140000 euros on Monday according to Markit

REUTERS - Fossil Inc  known for its watches and other fashion accessories said it expects its strong wholesale business in the Asia Pacific region to drive earnings this year and even expects its business in Europe to perform well sending its shares up more than 30 percent in early trading
Fossil whose watches sell from $7 to upwards of $2000 said second-quarter revenue rose in both regions helping it to report stronger-than-expected earnings and allowing it forecast earnings above Wall Street expectations
The strong results and upbeat outlook come at a time when many retailers are experiencing a slowdown in crisis-hit Europe and formerly hot emerging markets such as China
Long term we see strong opportunities for market share gains throughout Europe as we look to expand our existing owned-distribution footprint and to take advantage of the strong appeal of the Skagen brand in the region Chief Executive Kosta Kartsotis said on a conference call with analysts
Fossil bought privately held Danish watch maker Skagen Designs Ltd in January to expand in Europe
The company said it was positive on its wholesale business in Asia which grew 29 percent in the quarter saying it saw strong demand for its luxury brands in the region
We believe the robust appetite for accessories (in Asia) coupled with the developing 'white space' is a significant opportunity for both the Fossil brand and for our multi-brand watch portfolio a company executive said on the call referring to largely unexplored markets
Fossil's shares which had lost more than 40 percent of their value since the company last reported results in May were up 33 percent at $9257 in early trading on the Nasdaq
The company which sells its namesake brand as well as Armani Exchange Marc by Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors Holdings Ltd products said it expects full-year adjusted earnings $529 to $534 per share
Analysts on average had been expecting earnings of $528 per share on that basis according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S
Second-quarter earnings rose to $573 million or 92 cents per share from $514 million or 80 cents per share a year earlier On an adjusted basis the company earned 93 cents per share Analysts on average had expected 78 cents per share
The company whose retail customers range from Wal-Mart Stores Inc to high-end Neiman Marcus Group Inc  said revenue rose 143 percent to $6361 million beating the average analyst forecast of $6349 million
Revenue in its wholesale segment which accounts for more than half of the company's revenue rose about 14 percent to $4819 million Wholesale revenue in North America rose 17 percent to $2498 million on improved sales of watches and its Skagen-branded products
Revenue from the company's direct-to-consumer segment which includes more than 400 company-owned stores catalogs and e-commerce activities rose 15 percent to $1542 million
